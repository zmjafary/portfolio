## 🙏 A Special Thanks

I want to express my heartfelt thanks and appreciation to Brittany Chiang for her exceptional work on [brittanychiang.com](https://brittanychiang.com). Her fourth iteration of the site, built with Gatsby, served as the inspiration for my own portfolio. Brittany’s creativity, design, and attention to detail are truly inspiring.

Using Brittany’s work as a foundation for my own portfolio has been both an honor and a learning experience. If you’re interested in web design and development, I highly recommend checking out Brittany’s site and acknowledging her contribution to the web community.

**Please note:** While I have used the structure and design as inspiration, I have customized the content and styling to create a unique representation of my own work.
